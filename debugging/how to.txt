Stlink package is broken with chinese stm32 clone.
Use custom openocd config file

Use openocd:
openocd -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f ./clonestm32f1x.cfg

If you have an official stm32 board, use
openocd -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/target/stm32f1x.cfg

Use gdb-multiarch or arm-none-eabi-gdb
Once in, load the file to debug with "file ./a.out"
Connect to openocd with "target extended-remote :3333"
Then run "monitor reset"
Set up any desired breakpoints,
Then type "start" and press enter
